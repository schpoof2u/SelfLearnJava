# SelfLearnJava
A new Java repo of where I showcase my progress from various sources. these sources are from two books:

    Learn Java In one day and learn it well by Jamie Chan
    Thinking In Java 4th edition by Bruce Eckel

and the last source from a udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/

This repository is meant to replace the PersonalJava repository. the reasons for the replacement is for as follows:

    very little progress has been made in the course
    frustration is arising from the fact that I have not made anything in java
    I feel that I have lost myself in the course and am not doing the course for fun or to learn
    I want to have a fresh start

you can still look at the PersonalJava repository to see what I had learned, I will retain the knowledge from that course
